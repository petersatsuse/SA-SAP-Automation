////
The strategy elements are typically used to model the strategic direction and choices of an enterprise, as far as the impact on its architecture is concerned. They can be used to express how the enterprise wants to create value for its stakeholders, the capabilities it needs for that, the resources needed to support these capabilities, and how it plans to configure and use these capabilities and resources to achieve its aims. Strategy elements are used to model the strategic direction and choices of the enterprise, whereas Business Layer elements are used to model the operational organization of an enterprise.

*Why* one should consider this strategy

Most SAP services are deployed on-premises with well-established procedures, but it is important to plan and size the required hardware several years ahead and estimate the maximum workload, e.g., for the next 5 years. 

Predicting the future is not easy.  When considering requirements, such as capacity, many factors may affect the system over its lifespan.  This means that selections often end up being just a "best guess."

Today, with quickly changing environments, many businesses need to accelerate innovation and increase agility across their entire landscape in order to achieve a faster time-to-market in addition to managing costs.  Migrating products and services to the cloud can help businesses become more flexible and agile to meet changing business demands.

One key benefit of the cloud is that a business no longer needs to plan hardware sizing for the next 5 years.  Larger, faster, or even smaller infrastructure is only one reboot away. Still, "rightsizing" or infrastructure optimization remains an important task and should be front of mind when managing an SAP Landscape in the cloud.  Not taking care of this cloud benefit could have large cost implications.  Companies that “rightsize” their workloads are often able to cut costs by 30-60%.

=== Context

There are many benefits gained when moving your SAP workloads to the cloud:

Quick deployment:: If you need fast application implementation and deployment, the cloud is the best choice. You can set up a cloud environment within a few hours, whereas, in-house IT infrastructure setup takes days and sometimes months. With the cloud and SUSE's automation solution for SAP, IT teams can easily configure and manage the setup remotely.

Reduce Costs:: Many businesses spend a lot of their capital on maintaining their IT Infrastructure.  With help of the cloud, they can transform their CapEx (Capital Expenditure) to stable OpEx (Operating Expenditure).
Costs can be controlled as the cloud model is a ‘pay as you use’ scenario, and many cloud vendors provide several consumption options to provide more choice to their customers. 
SUSE, together with the cloud providers, can offer the right options that help businesses adapt to a cloud model. 
 
Scalability & Flexibility:: With the cloud and ready-to-run SUSE images, businesses can scale up or scale down resources as needed.  "Rightsizing" and instance optimization are still important, though, to maintain an efficient solution.

Maintenance:: In the cloud, IT departments no longer have to worry about managing and maintaining the hardware and underlying infrastructure.  The cloud service provider handles this, freeing up company resources to focus on innovation and other business activities.
      
Resiliency:: Uptime is of prime importance to ensure day-to-day business operations run smoothly.  Moving to the cloud maximizes uptime and reduces downtime.
The cloud improves disaster recovery and business continuity without the need to spend a huge amount of capital on robust disaster recovery tools.  Cloud providers offer a variety of services to help protect businesses from any security threat or outage.  SUSE's SAP HA automation augments these services to further reduce downtime of SAP applications.
    
Remote access:: The cloud allows employees to access data from anywhere and at any time, making business more flexible and increasing productivity.  SUSE products natively provide many options for remote access and control.
    

Overall, SUSE and public clouds offer significant benefits for all customers, regardless of size.  The use of cloud resources can lower infrastructure costs and improve the scalability, agility, flexibility, and availability of SAP applications.
