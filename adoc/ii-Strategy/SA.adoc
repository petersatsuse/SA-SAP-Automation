== Strategy

////
The strategy elements are typically used to model the strategic direction and choices of an enterprise, as far as the impact on its architecture is concerned. They can be used to express how the enterprise wants to create value for its stakeholders, the capabilities it needs for that, the resources needed to support these capabilities, and how it plans to configure and use these capabilities and resources to achieve its aims. Strategy elements are used to model the strategic direction and choices of the enterprise, whereas Business Layer elements are used to model the operational organization of an enterprise.

*Why* one should consider this strategy
////

Most SAP services are deployed on-premises with well-established procedures, but significant planning must go into these deployments. For example, workload growth must be estimated and planned for in hardware requirements, often several years in advance.

Predicting the future is not easy. When considering requirements, such as storage capacity, many factors may affect the system over its lifespan. Selections often end up being just "best guesses."

With today's quickly changing environments, many businesses need to accelerate innovation and increase agility across their entire landscape in order to achieve a faster time-to-market and manage costs. Migrating products and services to the cloud can help businesses become more flexible and agile to meet changing business demands.

One key benefit of the cloud is that a business no longer needs to plan hardware sizing for the next five or more years. Larger, faster, or even smaller infrastructure is only one reboot away.

However, "rightsizing" (or infrastructure optimization) remains an important consideration. Businesses that actively manage "rightsizing" their environment can cut operating costs by 30 to 60 percent.

=== Context

There are many benefits gained when moving SAP workloads to the cloud:

Quick deployment:: If you need fast application implementation and deployment, the cloud is the best choice. You can set up a cloud environment within a few hours, whereas, in-house IT infrastructure can take days or even months to order, install, configure, and bring online.
+
With SUSE's automation solution for SAP, IT teams can easily and quickly implement and deploy their SAP Landscape remotely in the cloud.

Reduce Costs:: Many businesses experience large CapEx (Capital Expenditure) to maintain IT infrastructure, with purchases often in advance of actual need. The cloud helps businesses transform to a more efficient OpEx (Operating Expenditure) model, with several consumption options, including "pay as you use," that let businesses manage their infrastructure costs.
+
SUSE, together with the cloud providers, can offer the right options to control costs, but this also requires businesses to adapt how they use the resources and SAP software.

Scalability & Flexibility:: With the cloud, businesses can scale up or scale down resources as needed. This makes it much easier to "rightsize" the environment and ensure efficient use of resources that can also adjust to meet changing business demands.

Maintenance:: With the cloud, IT departments no longer have to worry about managing and maintaining the hardware and underlying infrastructure. The cloud service provider handles this, freeing up company resources to focus on innovation and other business needs.
+
Businesses who deploy their SAP Landscapes with SUSE products and SUSE best practices automation experience simplified maintenance and less downtime.

Resiliency:: Uptime is of prime importance to ensure day-to-day business operations run smoothly. Moving to the cloud maximizes uptime and reduces downtime.
The cloud improves disaster recovery and business continuity without the need to spend a huge amount of capital on robust disaster recovery tools. And, cloud providers offer a variety of services to help protect businesses from security threats and outages.
+
SUSE's SAP HA automation augments these services to further reduce downtime of SAP applications.

Remote access:: The cloud allows employees to access data from anywhere and at any time, making business more flexible and increasing productivity.
+
SUSE products natively provide many options for remote access and control.

Overall, SUSE and public clouds offer significant benefits for all customers, regardless of size. The use of cloud resources can lower infrastructure costs and improve the scalability, agility, flexibility, and availability of SAP applications.
